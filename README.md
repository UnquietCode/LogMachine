#LogMachine (v0.0)
#### *I'm just a log machine!*

Semantic logging in Java. Not a framework!
Wraps around existing tools like SLF4J, Logback, Log4J, JDK1.4, and more.

You might need the latest [Flapi](https://github.com/UnquietCode/Flapi) in order to build.

Check out some of [the tests](https://github.com/UnquietCode/LogMachine/blob/master/lm-core/src/test/java/unquietcode/tools/logmachine/TestBasicLogMachine.java#L143) for usage patterns.

More to come...
