### lm-to-elasticsearch

Appender component for logging directly to ElasticSearch. Also included
are formatters which can write to the Logstash JSON format (versions 1
and 2). This is the data format expected by [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/)
when visualizing log data in an ElasticSearch cluster.
